# 🦠 Avian Influenza (HPAI) Analysis using Deep Learning 💻

## Overview 📜

This project aims to analyze data related to Avian Influenza (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza - HPAI) using deep learning techniques. The initial data exploration focuses on episode ratings (misleading, from old notebook) and other characteristics obtained from a CSV file. The goal is to explore the data and identify potential trends or patterns.

**🚨 IMPORTANT: The project currently contains a notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) with content related to Money Heist episode analysis. This `README` assumes that this notebook will be updated with code relevant to avian influenza analysis using deep learning. 🚨**

## Data 📊

The data (currently - but **should be changed**) is stored in the `MoneyHeist.csv` file. The CSV contains the following columns:

*   **Date:** 📅 Release date of the episode (should be Avian Flu Date).
*   **Season:** 🔢 Season number (likely irrelevant).
*   **Episode:** 🔢 Episode number within the season (likely irrelevant).
*   **Title:** 💬 Episode title (original language - should be replaced).
*   **Title(English):** 💬 Episode title (English translation - should be replaced).
*   **Description:** 📝 Episode description/summary (should be replaced).
*   **Rate:** ⭐ Episode rating (likely from IMDb - irrelevant).
*   **RateNumber:** 🗳️ Number of ratings for the episode (irrelevant).

**⚠️ WARNING: This data description is based on the Money Heist data in the notebook. It MUST be updated to reflect the actual Avian Influenza data. ⚠️**

**Expected Avian Influenza Data Fields:**

*   **Location:** 📍 Geographic location of reported cases.
*   **Date:** 📅 Date of reported case.
*   **Species:** 🐦 Species affected.
*   **Virus Strain:** 🧬 Strain of the Avian Influenza virus.
*   **[Other relevant features]** ➕

## Project Structure 📂

*   `KNN.ipynb`: 📓 Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis. (**MUST BE UPDATED!**)
*   `MoneyHeist.csv`: 💾 The dataset used for initial exploration. (**MUST BE REPLACED!**)

## Dependencies ⚙️

The project uses the following Python libraries:

*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   tensorflow or pytorch (for deep learning - add these and other requirements)

You can install these using `pip` (remember to create a `requirements.txt` file):
